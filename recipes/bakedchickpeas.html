            <h3>4-ingredient baked roasted chickpeas that are ACTUALLY crispy! 
                Simple methods, BIG flavor, so crunchy and delicious! 
                Plus, plant-based and gluten-free.</h3>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>1 15-ounce can chickpeas</ul>
                <ul>1 Tbsp oil</ul>
                <ul>1/2 tsp salt</ul>
                <ul>1 tsp seasonings of choice. We suggest Paprika & Curry Powder</ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and set out a bare baking sheet (or more, as needed).</ol>
                <ol>Drain chickpeas well. If using oil, rinse well with water and thoroughly drain. If omitting oil, simply drain well and skip rinsing with water.</ol>
                <ol>Once drained well, spread the chickpeas out on a clean, absorbent towel and use your hands to gently roll and dry the chickpeas. Some of the skins should start coming off. You can opt to peel all of the chickpeas – which can help for extra crispiness! – or simply remove the skins that come off. Either way, the chickpeas will crisp up. I just found that peeling them does yield slightly crispier chickpeas.</ol>
                <ol>Transfer the chickpeas to a mixing bowl and top with oil (or omit) and salt. Mix well to combine. DO NOT add the other seasoning at this point – it can interrupt the crisping process, so wait to add until after baking.</ol>
                <ol>Bake for a total of 40-50 minutes or until golden brown and dry/crispy to the touch. I like turning my pan around and shaking the chickpeas around at the halfway point for even cooking. Note: peeled chickpeas cook faster than unpeeled. If omitting oil, they will also cook faster.</ol>
                <ol>Remove from oven and toss with seasonings (if desired) while still warm. Then let cool 5-10 minutes – they will continue crisping as they cool.</ol>
             <ol>Serve as is or atop bowls or salads! To store, place in a storage container or jar and DO NOT tightly cover. Instead, crack lid so they can “breathe” a bit. I found that this helped them stay crispy longer. These are best in the first day, but they will last for 4-5 days at room temperature. Alternatively, seal well and freeze up to 1 month.</ol>
